THE REAL BUG FIX
================

PROBLEM: Stops placed and cancelled on same day

ROOT CAUSE: 
- Pending stops from previous bar were placed at START of next()
- Then rebalance check ran and cancelled them
- All on the same bar!

THE FIX:
Check if today is rebalance day FIRST
- If YES: Skip stop placement, cancel old stops, rebalance
- If NO: Safe to place pending stops from yesterday

RESULT:
Day 21 (rebalance): Cancel stops, rebalance (no placement)
Day 22: Place stops queued from Day 21 orders
Days 22-40: Stops protect positions
Day 41 (rebalance): Repeat cycle

Test your strategy now - should be fixed!
